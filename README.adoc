[NOTE]

This documentation is work in progress!

The Data Collector (DC) is a framework for consuming REST APIs where collected data is written to streams. The DC executes a declarative Specification at runtime that describes how data should be collected. The Specification is built using a well defined DSL.

Example of use: https://github.com/statisticsnorway/data-collection-consumer-specifications[Statistics Norway's Consumer Specifications].
